# Smart-Sensor-System-for-Water-Purity-Monitoring

This repository contains the sensors code files and documentation for an IoT-based water quality monitoring system using Arduino microcontrollers and sensors. 
The system measures key water quality parameters including Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), turbidity, and temperature in real-time.
